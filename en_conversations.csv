conversation_b4ld5b_text	Anyway, he said that he found traces of some mutagen polluting the biology of the plants.	Speaker=Professor Sherman

conversation_bthpa5_text	There {format emph}are{format reset} a lot of pipes running through that place.	Speaker=Dorothy
conversation_wvpx34_text	That could definitely be the source of the pollutant.	Speaker=Professor Sherman
